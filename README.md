### 🧩 About Me
I'm a precision optics specialist and software developer with over 8 years of hands-on experience in ultra-precision diamond turning.  
My background is rooted in **Single Point Diamond Turning (SPDT)** of infrared optics — working with materials like Ge, Si, ZnSe, CaF₂, and polymers — and mastering sub-micron tolerances on **Precitech** and **Nanotech** machines.

Over the years, I saw how complex and fragmented optical manufacturing workflows can be.  
That insight led me to build **DTM Studio**, a dedicated software platform that automates G-code generation, applies real tool-radius compensation, integrates metrology data for surface correction, and simplifies the entire SPDT process from start to finish.
